# TODOs
- Generalize the "devices" buttons so they automatically get populated and given listeners and hover states and behaviors.
- Separate the "alert another entity" part of radar scan behavior into its own behavior.
- Use radar scan behavior instead of collision detection to handle enemy detection. (Can probably remove the concept of attachments at this time too.)
